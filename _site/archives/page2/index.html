    Using Android Studio
  </a>
  
  <p class='archives'>
  <!--<b>[]</b> -->
  
  We will use the Android Studio for these examples. Android Studio is an IDE specifically designed for Android Development. It does the things that Eclipse + ADT does. It basically combined all the tools you use when working on an Android app. It is based on IntelliJ, so you know it has pedigree. You don’t need to switch to this...

  <!--<b>[]</b> -->
  
  Most of the time, you will deal with more than one moving object inside the canvas, they might need to move at different speedss. You could be tempted to set a different timer (setTimeout) for each box, that will be a mistake. You will mess up the timer of your canvas. The way to approach the problem of moving objects...

  When you start working with non-trivial Canvas applications, you will need to deal with multiple objects, having multiple shapes moving at different speeds and having different locations in the canvas. If you try to manage them all procedurally, you will soon run into the problem of very confusing and hard to maintain codes. JavaScript is an object oriented programming language...

  <!--<b>[]</b> -->
  
  To capture click events on the canvas, you will need to attach an event handler on the canvas itself, not the context. Since the canvas element is just like any other DOM element, attaching a click event to it is very straightforward. It can be done in any number of ways, the simplest is probably window.onload = function() { var...

  Collission detection inside the canvas needs to be managed by you. Everytime you update the location of any object, you will need to provide the programming logic to check if any of your canvas objects is colliding with any other object or if it is colliding with the bounds of the canvas. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;script&gt; var c =...

  The canvas is a 2D drawing surface. If you ever used Microsoft Paint before, then you have an idea of what it is. It basically exposes the capability to draw into a surface using pixels — it is bitmapped. The idea is to draw a pixel at a specific location and then apply some colors into it. This is as...

  Making objects fall inside the canvas is pretty straightforward. You simply need to move the object along the y-axis of the canvas. Each time you redraw the frame, incrase the y position of the object. To make the fall a bit more realistic, you need to add some acceleration. Speed of the object is simply the number of pixels displaced...

  Working with HTML5 does not require much.
