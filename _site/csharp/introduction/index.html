        <p>Programs are the stuff that you run on your computer; or tablets or phones—you probably know them better as apps. There are lots of things that you need in order to build an app, but the biggest and probably the most important thing you need is knowledge of a programming language.</p>

<p>A program is just a bunch of executable statements arranged in a specific order. Some statements execute right after another statement; some execute repeatedly while some conditions are true (or not), and then some statements are executed only when conditions are true.</p>

<p>The subject of this field guide is C# (pronounced see sharp) It is intended to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. Its development team was led by Anders Hejlsberg. The most recent version is C# 5.0, which was released on August 15, 2012. 1.</p>

<p>There are other things to say about this language, such as it is statically typed, supports class-based OOP, strongly typed and has support for both functional style and imperative type programming, but they won’t make sense right now. You need to know some basics about the language before any of these fancy vocabulary will make sense to you, so I will try to explain what they mean along the way. What maybe important to realize right now are the facts that C# is a high-level language and that it is compiled.</p>

<p>To speak loosely, computers can only run low-level instructions (sometimes they are also called machine instructions or assembly instructions). Low level languages are more difficult to write, that is why they are also more difficult to change. A high-level program on the other hand is written in an almost-English-like language. They are easier to learn and write (re-write).</p>

<p>A program written in a high level language will not be readily understood by a machine though, they need to be translated. There are two ways to translate high level languages. One is by compilation and the other is by interpretation. An interpreter is also computer program, it does what it says—it interprets a high-level program to machine language. It does so by reading a the high-level source file one line at the time, and executes them also one line at a time.</p>

<p>A compiler (which is also another computer program) reads a high level source code in its entirety and translates it in one fell swoop, then you can run the program.</p>
