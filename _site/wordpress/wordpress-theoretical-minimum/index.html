        <p>WordPress is built using a collection of technologies and languages. To build an application using this platform, you need a modicum of skill on <em>HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript</em> and <em>SQL</em></p>

<ol>
  <li><em>HTML</em>. Most of the things a CMS needs to do are already taken cared of by the WordPress core files. Things like creating new content, saving them on a data store and retrieving them for display are the kind of things WordPress does. You don’t need to do much. The heavy lifting has been done by WordPress. But you do need to take control of how the information is presented to the user. You need HTML for that</li>
  <li><em>PHP</em>. While the heavy lifting has already been done for you by WordPress, you still need to write a bit of PHP. Don’t worry, you won’t have to write a lot. But you need to know how to read and write basic PHP codes. </li>
  <li><em>CSS</em> is responsible for styling. The visual aspects of your application is dictated solely by this styling language. Arguably, you can build web pages without CSS, but I am risking a guess that you need your application to be visually appealing. Hence you need to have skill on styling</li>
  <li><em>JavaScript</em>. HTML, CSS and JavaScript are commonly found on web applications. They are the technologies on the client side — browser side. WordPress uses JS for mainly for plugins. But you may find that you have use for JavaScrip beyond simply plugins. The use of JS alongside CSS and HTML are increasingly becoming prevalent in the age of responsive designs</li>
  <li><em>SQL</em>. You may not use this at all, save for the few occasions like setup. I listed it here just for the sake of completeness and being thorough on the list of competencies. But honestly, I don’t think you will need to interact with MySQL database unless you will do something outside creating and reading posts/pages. SQL skills will become important when you start using WordPress to build something other than a CMS</li>
</ol>
