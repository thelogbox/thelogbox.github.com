JavaScript is a loose, dynamically typed and interpreted  scripting language. It began life as LiveScript (1995); when it was a project at Netscape Communications. At some point in time, it was renamed JavaScript (roughly around the time when plugin support for the Java language was added to Netscape Navigator).

Java and JavaScript are not related to each other, not even remotely, they simply share a commonality in their names.

JavaScript's popularity maybe attributed to it's ubiquity amongst web pages (client side JavaScript), but it is actually being used in lots of places other than web pages. JS can be ran on the server (Node.JS), it can be used to do MVC type development of web apps (Backbone.JS) and it can also be used to stitch together a bunch of Java apps together (Rhino); these are just some of the other uses of JavaScript. 

JavaScript as we know it today, is the scripting language consistent with ECMAScript. ECMAScript is a standardized scripting language according to ECMA specification 262 and ISO/IEC 16262. ECMAScript exist in the form of JavaScript, ActionScript and JScript. If you are looking for language specification of JavaScript, you can look at the ECMAScript 262 specification---it is included in the Bibliography.
