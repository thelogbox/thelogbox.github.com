When you create identifiers, e.g. variable names, function names and class names, you need to stay away from certain words--the JavaScript reserved words. Here they are;


- break case catch continue debugger default
- delete do else finally for function if in
- instanceof new return switch this throw try
- typeof var void while with implements
- interface let package private protected
- public static yield class enum export 
- extends import super


Read the ECMA specification for keywords, I just listed them here for convenience.
