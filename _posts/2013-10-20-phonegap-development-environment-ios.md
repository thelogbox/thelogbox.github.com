You need a Mac. The Apple&reg; tools needed to build iOS applications runs only on Apple&reg; hardware, lest you violate their TOS. Specifically, to build iOS apps using PhoneGap 3.0, you need an Intel based Mac and at least OSX 10.7 (Lion).

The second thing you need is XCode&reg;, at least version 4.5. Since OSX 10.7, XCode is no longer bundled on the installation DVD, you need to get it from the App Store. 

Once you have procured XCode, there is one more tiny thing to do. Download  the **Command Line Tools**. To do that, launch XCode, go to *Preferences* then click the *Downloads* tab.

Download the Command Line Tools. That will take a while. The size of the Command Line tools is quite hefty. Once the download is finished, launch the Terminal.app so we can quickly test if the tools are working. Run <code class="codeblock">clang --version</code> or <code class="codeblock">gcc --version</code>. If you did not get a *command not found* error, chances are the tools are working.

Now the XCode part is over, move on to the PhoneGap tool chain. 

# Tool Chain

**Node Package Manager**. You need the node packager manager to proceed. You can download it at the [NodeJS site](http://nodejs.org). Another way of getting **npm** is either via [HomeBrew](http://brew.sh) or [MacPorts](http://macports.org), I personally use BREW. It is a good idea to setup the BREW package manager because you will use it to get other tools that we need for PhoneGap.

When you are done with the npm installation, you can get the PhoneGap installers.

<pre class="codeblock">
$ npm install -g phonegap
$ npm install -g cordova
</pre>

# Quick Test

<pre class="codeblock">

$ mkdir ~/workarea
$ cd ~/workarea
$ phonegap create first
$ cd first
$ phonegap build ios
$ open platforms/ios/first

[phonegap] detecting iOS SDK environment...
[phonegap] using the local environment
[phonegap] adding the iOS platform...
[phonegap] compiling iOS...
[phonegap] successfully compiled iOS app

$ open platforms/ios/HelloWorld.xcodeproj

</pre>

After that last command, XCode will launch and open the ios project generated by PhoneGap.
