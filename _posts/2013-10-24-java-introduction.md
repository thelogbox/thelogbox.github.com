These are my notes on the Java Programming Language. These notes used to be hosted at [tedhagos.com/java-programming](http://tedhagos.com/java-programming), it was written on a single HTML page. Now, these notes are getting a rewrite. Most probably in tutorial form. There is a navigation bar on the side, please use it as you would a table of contents, I organized these notes as such.

These notes dates back to the late part of the 1990s. I update them from time to time. These were written primarily as a secondary reference for my students in Asia Pacific College and IBM ACE. It was not meant to be an introduction to computing concepts. It assumes that the reader has some degree of familiarization in basic programming concepts which may have been acquired from experience of another programming language.

Having said that, what follows will take you through a very quick tour of the Java programming language. This material was not designed to cover all the aspects of the language, as it will be impractical to do so. The breadth and depth of Java, with all the associated technologies have increased drastically since it was first introduced in 1995.

The code samples and exercises in this material were built using plain editors and the Java Development Kit. The use of simple tools is ideal for learning because there are no magic tricks and convenience facilities (like the case if you use an IDE). As a result, your brain will work harder because you are forced to use primitive tools. In a production environment or consulting environment, this reasoning might not be suitable and hence, the decision for tool selection will be influenced by other factors such as programmer productivity, time schedules and other constraints.

For the purpose of learning programming in Java — which is the goal of this material — we need our brains and faculties to work harder than usual to maximize learning and understanding.
