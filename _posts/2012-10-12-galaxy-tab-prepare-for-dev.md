To use the galaxy tab as a testing device;

1. Go to *Settings*
2. Then *Applications*
3. Enable **USB Debugging**

Do the above steps while the device is not yet connected to the PC, otherwise, the USB debugging options will be greyed out.

Connect the device, test it by running either **adb** or **logcat** on Terminal window.
