The job market for mobile applications is already huge and is growing at an enormous pace. People are using their mobile devices more than they are using their notebook or desktop computers, and Android based devices are being launched frequently.

As of May 2012, the number of apps that have been created and released for the android platform is over 500,000 (source: [DISTIMO: Google Android Market](http://www.distimo.com/appstores/app-store/19-Google_Android_Market)). Considering that the Google Playstore started late in 2008, in a little over four years, there has been an explosion of mobile apps.

While IOS enjoyed an early lead in terms of number of apps, the IOS dominance is no longer secured (source: [TechCrunch: Android overtakes IOS ...](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/23/android-overtakes-ios-in-app-downloads-in-uk-germany-russia-u-s-to-follow-next-month/)). It is plain to see that the momentum of mobile apps development is rapidly increasing. This creates a demand for programmers on the android platform. Excellent opportunities await those who are early and ready into this growing market.

There are many ways to learn android, you can read lots of books voraciously then practice; you can keep on reading tutorials available on the internet then practice; you can attend meetings of the local user groups, then practice; you can sign-up for workshops (hopefully this one) then practice some more. A combination of one, some or all of these things will ramp up your skills on android development but the fastest way is to attend a workshop because the materials have been prepared coherently and designed thoughtfully so that you can progress in a methodical and time-efficient way.
