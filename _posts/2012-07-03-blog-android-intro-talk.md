In a few hours, I will head back to Asia Pacific College to give an introductory talk about Android applications development. I haven't been to APC for a very long time, and I haven't talked in front of a crowd for a very long time as well, much less give an introductory talk inside an auditorium---but no matter, I think all will be well.  

I think I will structure the talk like this;

# What is it

1. A Linux based Operating System for mobile devices
2. Developed by OHA (Open Handset Alliance) led by Google Inc
3. A rich development platform for mobile applications

# The timeline

- 2003 - Android Inc., was founded by Andy Rubin
- 2005 - Android Inc was Acquired by Google
- 2008 - Android v1.0
- 2009 - Android v1.1 
- 2009 - v1.5 (CupCake), v1.6 (Donut)
- 2009 - v2.0/2.1 (Eclair)
- 2010 - v2.2 (Froyo), v2.3 (GingerBread)
- 2011 - v3.0 (HoneyComb)
- 2011 - v4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich)

# Why bother

<img src="/img/android-10billion.jpg" style="float:right" width="250px">

1. 10 Billion apps downloaded
2. Hundred thousand device activations per day
3. 500,000 apps downloaded from Google Play (IOS has roughly same number)

# Pros of Android development

1. Low barrier to entry - Android SDK runs on Linux, OSX and Windows
2. Volume - Lots of people are downloading apps
3. Easy to get started - Android apps are unlike enterprise apps---they have shorter  dev time


# The software stack

# Things you need to get started

1. Android SDK (downloadable from developer.android.com)
2. A development tool (Eclipse, NetBeans -- a programmerâ€™s editor will do)
3. JDK 1.5 or 1.6
4. Apache Ant
5. Java programming background
