There are a couple of things you need to do before you can get started. Here's a few of them

1. A development machine with lots of horsepower and lots of RAM. As much as you can afford. Ignore the minimum requirement, splurge on the machine. It doesn't matter what you choose, OSX, Linux or Windows. Android will work on all of them
2. A good internet connection (the SDK download is bit hefty)
3. A programmer's editor &mdash; vi, emacs, TextMate, Sublime2 etc. You can use an IDE if you like, there are plenty to choose from &mdash; NetBeans, Eclipse or Android Studio
4. A Java development environment (either JDK 1.5 or 1.6)
5. Apache Ant
7. Lastly, a Java Programming background. Some people tried to learn Java and Android at the same time. While that is possible, I would not recommend that route. Get comfortable in Java first before trying out Android, unless you don't mind the headaches.

# SETUP

Setup your JDK and Apache ANT before setting up the Android SDK. Once Java and Apache ANT are out of the way, the process simply involves downloading, installing and configuring the SDK. The configuration is where it sometimes gets messy and confusing especially for beginners. The expectation however, is that you already are a Java programmer and that these things are old hats to you. 

I used to keep a detailed and step-by-step (even pictorial) instructions of the setup routine in these pages, but they proved to be difficult to maintain and gets outdated quite quickly. Hence, I took them out and replaced them with links to resources that have better chances of being updated. 

First thing to look at is the official site of Android. They keep setup information [here](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) and [here](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html). If that is still not clear enough, you can look at the [setup instructions I wrote for my students here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AS8OoJJnRIIyEvi8lG6I8iF0PEt1-UolvQGtVevrJg4/edit?usp=sharing)


# THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH ANDROID

A lot of things. As mentioned before, Android is an operating system. It is also has a top-notch and proven development kit (plus libraries). If you add the very large number of developers in the Java Community who are tirelessly working to produce the *next best dev framework/library* to this equation, then it's a whole new ball game. That means (almost) everything we did on Desktop we can also on the mobile &mdash; plus more. I said almost because the mobile platform will play catch up with the desktop platform in terms of processing horse power &mdash; but that is just a matter of time.

The Android development platform has some basic building blocks e.g. *Activities* for user interfaces, *Content Providers* for data sources, *Intents* for event handling &mdash; it actually is more than just for event handling and activating windows/apps, but for the purpose of this document, we will settle for that. 

You can create applications that has timers, can multiprocess, can handle media (audio and video) and are *network-aware*. These are just a few of the things you can do with the Android Development platform.
