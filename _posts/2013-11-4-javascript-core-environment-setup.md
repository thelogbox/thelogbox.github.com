If you are reading this post, you already have the minimum tools you need to start coding in JavaScript. You just need a modern browser, a text editor and a good internet connection. Meeting the minimum requirement does not mean it's ideal for development. I really don't like prescribing tools because choice of coding weapons tend to be personal in nature, but allow me to risk some recommendations. Please find them below.

1. *A modern browser*. IE9/10, latest stable build of Chrome, FireFox or Safari. I suppose you would like to write code that is compliant with the current ECMAScript specification. Chances are, modern browsers will be compliant
2. *Programmer's editor*. You can get by using Notepad, TextWrangler or GEdit. But do yourself a favor. Get a real programmer's editor. Something that is capable of chroma coding (syntax highlight), code folding, configurable indents/soft tabs etc.
3. *Reasonably fast internet connection.* You might want to use some of the online code editors for JS like JSFiddle.net or JSBin.com, you will need a fast internet for those
4. *NodeJS runtime*. Your background of JavaScript may have been influenced by browser side scripting. NodeJS is something you would use for server side JavaScript. The main reason I am urging you to get Node is because of the runtime. It will be handy if you have access to a CLI environment of JavaScript. It can be downloaded from the [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org) site
