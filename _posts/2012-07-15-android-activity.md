A great number of mobile applications will need a user interface. Not all apps need a UI, but most do. In Android Programming, User Interfaces are built using a couple of files, usually a java source file with an associated XML file. The java source file used, most commonly is class that inherits androd.app.Activity. You don't need to worry these things so much because both the XML file and the Java source file would have been created automatically during the project creation process.

You will be increasingly aware of how much Android uses XML files. It uses XML a lot. Defining a user interface using XML files is one of two ways you can write UI codes in Android. The other way is do it programmatically. Programmatic UI definition is very similar to AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) programming in Core Java. You will recognize the reference if you did that sort of thing in core Java programming, if not, that's okay. I didn't assume that you have background in AWT or Swing programming anyway. 

In this chapter, we will use the XML to build user interfaces. We will build our UI declaratively.

***

To get started, create a new project. If you haven't gone through the [Getting Started](/android-getting-started) section, now would be a good time to leave this section, read through **Getting Started** then come back.   

<pre class="codeblock">$ android create project --target 8 path hello --activity Hello --package com.thelogbox 
</pre>

Go to the project folder. Go to the *src* directory and drill down to the java source file, you will see the default source code that the Android *create project* command generated.

{% highlight java %}
  
// source file: src/com/thelogbox/HelloWorld.java

package com.thelogbox;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.widget.Toast;
import android.content.Context;
import android.view.View;

public class HelloWorld extends Activity {
  /** Called when the activity is first created. */
    
  @Override
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
      setContentView(R.layout.main);
  }
}

{% endhighlight %}
<div id='lst'>/src/com/thelogbox/HelloWorld.java</div>

It is a basic Java class that extended the *android.app.Activity* class. Take a look at the last statement inside the <code class="codeblock">onCreate()</code> method. That last statement is a directive on where and how to the get the instructions for building the user interface. 

The <code class="codeblock">setContentView()</code> is an overloaded method of Activity, it can take various parameter(s) and type. In our example, what was passed as parameter was *R.layout.main* &mdash; it is an integer constant. but don't worry about that now, that is not yet relevant. What is relevant is that the *R class* was auto-generated by Android &mdash; specifically, it was generated by the <code class="codeblock">appt</code>, short for *android asset packaging tool*. 

*R.layout.main* maps to main.xml which can be found on the folder *res/layout/main.xml*.

{% highlight xml %}

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  android:orientation="vertical"
  android:layout_width="fill_parent"
  android:layout_height="fill_parent"
  >
<TextView  
  android:layout_width="fill_parent" 
  android:layout_height="wrap_content" 
  android:text="Hello World"
  />    
</LinearLayout>

{% endhighlight %}
<div id='lst'>/res/layout/main.xml</div>

The main node of the XML file is *LinearLayout*, this is not always the case, there are a couple of layouts to choose from in Android. We will circle back to this later, but for now, let's use the LinearLayout. 

Think of the LinearLayout as the equivalent of *java.awt.FlowLayout* in JSE. It organizes the widgets by stacking them together linearly, from left to right, then top to bottom. 

Inside the main LinearLayout node is the *TextView* tag. This is the equivalent of *java.awt.Label* or *javax.swing.JLabel*. It is a static text widget. You won't be able to edit them, they are simple labels. 

The order of how the views are defined in the XML affects the order of how the views are displayed. This is the simplest layout, that is why I chose this as a starting point.

We will add another *View component* to our screen, an Editable Text. Go back to the editor and insert another view inside the LinearLayout main node. 

{% highlight xml %}
<!-- main.xml -->>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  android:orientation="vertical"
  android:layout_width="fill_parent"
  android:layout_height="fill_parent"
  >
	<TextView  
    android:layout_width="fill_parent" 
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" 
    android:text="Hello World"
    />
	<EditText
		android:layout_width="fill_parent"
		android:layout_height="wrap_content"
	/>
</LinearLayout>

{% endhighlight %}

*EditText* is an editable text component that is very similar to javax.swing.JTextField. The android platform knows how to handle the EditText. Once this view has focus, the on-screen keyboard will pop so that the user can begin input. You do not need to handle the popping of the keyboard, it will be done for you automatically.

Once you are done with edits, compile and test the project &mdash; <code class="codeblock">$ ant debug install</code>
 
<img class="small" src="/img/lin-sample-1.png" width="300">
<div id='lst'>Your second app</div>

We can still improve the appearance of the app, it doesn't look right because of the way the label is positioned. We will fix that on the next chapter.
