A great number of mobile applications will need a user interface. Not all apps need a UI, but most do. In Android Programming, User Interfaces are built using a couple of files. Mainly you build a UI using an *Activity* class and an XML file. When you create a project using the SDK tools &mdash; <code class="codeblock">android create</code> &mdash; it includes a default Activity class and a default main.xml file which is used by the Activity class.  

There are two ways to write UI codes in Android, declarative and programmatically. The programmatic method of defining the UI involves instantiating the views (widgets) inside your code and attaching them to containers e.g. another View object. 

The declarative way of UI building involves defining the views inside the an XML document. The XML doc is parsed by the compiler and the UI is magically built for you. For beginning Android programmers, this is the easier way. This is the route we will take in this chapter.

***

To get started, create a new project. If you haven't gone through the [Getting Started](/android-getting-started) section, now would be a good time to leave this section, read through **Getting Started** then come back.   


<code class="codeblock">$ android create project --target 8 path hello --activity Hello --package com.thelogbox </code>


Go to your project folder, go to the *src* directory and drill down to the java source file, you will see the default source code that the Android *create project* command generated.

{% highlight java %}
  
// source file: src/com/thelogbox/HelloWorld.java

package com.thelogbox;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.widget.Toast;
import android.content.Context;
import android.view.View;

public class HelloWorld extends Activity {
    /** Called when the activity is first created. */
    
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.main);
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

It is a basic Java class that extended the *android.app.Activity* class. Take a look at the last statement inside the <code class="codeblock">onCreate()</code> method. That last statement is a directive on where and how to the get the instructions for building the user interface. 

The <code class="codeblock">setContentView()</code> is an overloaded method of Activity, it can take various parameter(s) and type. In our example, what was passed as parameter was *R.layout.main* &mdash; it is an integer constant. but don't worry about that now, that is not yet relevant. What is relevant is that the *R class* was auto-generated by Android &mdash; specifically, it was generated by the <code class="codeblock">appt</code>, short for *android asset packaging tool*. 

*R.layout.main* maps to main.xml which can be found on the folder *res/layout/main.xml*.

{% highlight xml %}

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  android:orientation="vertical"
  android:layout_width="fill_parent"
  android:layout_height="fill_parent"
  >
<TextView  
  android:layout_width="fill_parent" 
  android:layout_height="wrap_content" 
  android:text="Hello World"
  />    
</LinearLayout>

{% endhighlight %}


The main node of this XMl file is *LinearLayout*, this is not always the case, there are a couple of layouts to choose from in Android. We will circle back to this later, but for now, let's use the LinearLayout. 

Think of the LinearLayout as the equivalent of *java.awt.FlowLayout* in JSE. It organizes the widgets by stacking them together linearly, from left to right, then top to bottom. 

Inside the main LinearLayout node is the *TextView* tag. This is the equivalent of *java.awt.Label* or *javax.swing.JLabel*. It is a static text widget. You won't be able to edit them, they are simple labels. 

The order of how the views are defined in the XML affects the order of how the views are displayed. This is the simplest layout, that is why I chose this as a starting point.

We will add another *View component* to our screen, an Editable Text. Go back to the editor and insert another view inside the LinearLayout main node. 


{% highlight xml %}
<!-- main.xml -->>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  android:orientation="vertical"
  android:layout_width="fill_parent"
  android:layout_height="fill_parent"
  >
	<TextView  
    android:layout_width="fill_parent" 
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" 
    android:text="Hello World"
    />
	<EditText
		android:layout_width="fill_parent"
		android:layout_height="wrap_content"
	/>
</LinearLayout>

{% endhighlight %}

*EditText* is an editable text component that is very similar to javax.swing.JTextField. The android platform knows how to handle the EditText. Once this view has focus, the on-screen keyboard will pop so that the user can begin input. You do not need to handle the popping of the keyboard, it will be done for you automatically.

Once you are done with edits, compile and test the project &mdash; <code class="codeblock">$ ant debug install</code>
 
<img class="small" src="/img/lin-sample-1.png" width="300">
<div id='lst'>Your second app</div>

We can still improve the appearance of the app, it doesn't look right because of the way the label is positioned. We will fix that on the next chapter.
