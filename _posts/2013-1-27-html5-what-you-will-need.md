Working with HTML5 does not require much. You can get by with the tools you probably already have &mdash; an HTML5 compliant browser, a programmer's editor or any text editor for that matter and a good internet connection.

Some tools are better than others but tooling is a highly debatable question, at the end of the day go with what you are most comfortable with. Sometimes, you may have not have a say on the tools because they have already been picked for you &mdash; by a tech lead, a client or your company standards. 

Having said that, here are some suggestions.

Get Google Chrome and FireFox. IE10 and Safari works too. I cannot specify the versions because a month from now, that will be outdated information. I will encourage you instead to test your browser by going to [HTML5Test.com](http://html5test.com/).

Get a decent programmer's editor. One that supports code folding, syntax coloring and customizable keys. You can get started with NotePad but that was not designed to be a programmer's editor. There are many reasons but the biggest for me is that it won't help me manage tab spaces and pairing of curly braces &mdash; if you try to code with it long enough I am sure you will have your own reason. NotePad++ is not a bad choice to start with, Sublime Text2 is also a good one. Vim or any of it's variant (GVim, MacVim etc) are excellent choices. That list should you get started for now until you have developed your own personal preferences for programmer's editor.

Try considering some online code editors like [JSFiddle.net](http://jsfiddle.net) and [JSBin.com](http://jsbin.com). If you have a reliable internet connection they are excellent coding tools for learning purposes.

# OTHER THINGS YOU NEED


**A background in earlier versions of HTML.** If you are attending a training, a workshop or a class, this will most likely be covered in a review session &mdash; it's not terribly difficult

**A willingness to learn JavaScript.** A lot of features of HTML5 responsible for the noise it is making is its API &mdash; you need JavaScript to take advantage of those APIs

**References, lots of it.** The markup and the new language structure of HTML5 may not be daunting but you might get stuck on the other APIs like WebSocket, Canvas, WebGL, GEOLocation, just to name a few

**A teacher.** If you can afford to go to a paid session, that is best because (presumably) there is a learning plan laid it for you so you can move in the direction of skill and competence with little delays. You can economise on time which would otherwise be squandered if you tried the experimentations yourself. If you cannot attend classes and are forced to self study, at least try to find a support group where you can throw questions (and hopefully contribute also) and get some programming tips.
