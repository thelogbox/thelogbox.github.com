Welcome to HTML5 tutorial. This is a mini site. It contains howto's and lots of code examples about HTML5 programming.

There is a nav bar on the right. Use it as you would a *table of contents*. I tried to organize them as such. 

These were compiled from training sessions I have conducted and from projects I have done. My name is Ted Hagos, I am the CTO of RenditionDigital Inc. It's software company with headquarters in Dublin, Ireland and and office in Manila, Philippines. I have also, at another life, been a programming instructor at Asia Pacific College, Ateneo ITI and IBM Advance Career Education.

I hope you find something useful in these pages.

Regards,


Ted
