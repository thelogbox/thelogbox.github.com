At the time of writing, Eclipse version is Juno

1. Launch Eclipse
2. Go to **Help**, then **Install new software**
3. On the textbox that says *work with:, type **https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/**, then click *Add*
4. Choose **Developer Tools** on the checkboxes, you can choose to ignore the NDK tools
5. Review the install details, then click **Next**
6. Accept the terms and conditions, then proceed
7. You might get some warnings "about the authenticity of the software you are downloading", just proceed
8. A *Restart Eclipse* window might appear, just click *Ok* to restart eclipse
9. An android welcome dialog will pop. It will ask you to do either one of two things. To **install a new android SDK** or to **use an existing android SDK**. Choose the one that makes sense to you. 
10. I have installed the android SDK already, that is why I chose to **use an existing SDK**. Browse to the location of your android SDK. Click **next**
11. Finish
