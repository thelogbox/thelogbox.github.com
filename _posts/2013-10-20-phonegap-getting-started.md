PhoneGap development starts with preparing a project folder. Inside this folder, you will find files and sub folders. This project structure is a collection of specific files that PhoneGap needs to do its work. Inside it are build files, library files, the Apache Cordova middle ware and typical web components/files e.g. HTML, JavaScript, CSS and some image assets. It will be difficult and impractical to assemble them by hand that is why PhoneGap includes a CLI (Command Line Interface) with its SDK. 

The PhoneGap CLI (Command Line Interface) has a set of commands that allows you create, build and install mobile app projects. If you have a proper installation of the PhoneGap development environment, you should be able to execute *phonegap* from the command line. In fact, it's a good idea to test it now before you proceed any further, just to make sure that it really is working. 

Invoking *phonegap* from cmd line displays its usage.

As you can see, there are lots of things we can do with it. We can create, build and install mobile app projects using this command. In this chapter, we will create our first project using the PhoneGap CLI. We won't do anything with it just yet, we simply want to sample the feel of the  workflow and get acquainted with the process of creating, testing and building PhoneGap projects. Before the chapter is done, we would have created, built and tested a sample project in either an iOS simulator or an Android emulator.

To create a project, get a terminal window (cmd.exe in Windows, Terminal.app in OSX, xterm in Linux)

If you are using either Linux or OSX, this is the set of command to follow

![Project Creation. OSX](/img/phonegap/phonegap-create-project-osx.png)
<div id='lst'>Project Creation. OSX</div>

The first time you execute the *create* command, PhoneGap will try to pull some setup files and libraries from the internet, so you need to be connected while you are doing this.

The *create* command will produce a folder named **first** in the current working directory, go to that folder.

A PhoneGap app comes with batteries included. The project creation includes a starter *index.html* file that does a couple of things. It detected an event called *deviceready* and it will display a nice looking image of PhoneGap.

## Difference from Desktop App or Web App Programming









## Building on Android




## Building on iOS 



If you have a physical android, iOS or Windows8 device plugged into the USB of your development machine, you can try to install our first project &mdash; type `phonegap run android`. I am using Android that is why the target is *android*. This command will pull some more files from the internet, then build an android target, then compile the android target before it finally installs the built *.apk* onto your device.

If you have a properly installed Android development setup

T>If you encounter some problems during compilation and build, try to check where you placed your working folder. The PhoneGap CLI does not like folders that have white spaces in them e.g. *C:\\Documents and Settings\\yourname\\workfolder\\first*

A> `phonegap create first` creates and prepares a Phonegap project folder and files. `phonegap run android` adds the android platform to your project, compiles and installs an android project to either a connected physical device or an emulator.

Let's examine the project folder we just created.  



There are four folders. Merges, Platforms, Plugins and WWW. The WWW folder is where you will spend most of your time as a PhoneGap developer. This folder contains all of the User Interface elements that your app will have. 

Try to inspect the contents of index.html. This file was generated by the PhoneGap CLI during project creation. 


{% highlight html %}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta name="format-detection" content="telephone=no" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, width=device-width, height=device-height, target-densitydpi=device-dpi" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/index.css" />
  <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
 <div class="app">
   <h1>PhoneGap</h1>
   <div id="deviceready" class="blink">
   <p class="event listening">Connecting to Device</p>
   <p class="event received">Device is Ready</p>
   </div>
  </div>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="phonegap.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="js/index.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript">
     app.initialize();
  </script>
</body>
</html>

{% endhighlight %}

That is the default index.html which is responsible for the welcome screen. There are a lot things going in there which we don't need for now, so we will take them out. Edit it and replace it with the following;


If you would like to deploy this in an IOS device, you will need to do the following.

1. Go to the project directory, the "first" folder
2. Run the command `phonegap build ios`. The PhoneGap CLI may warn you that you don't have the *ios-sim* package just yet. It will give you instructions on how to get it, either from homebrew or a git pull
3. Go to the *platforms/ios* folder and double-click the file that has the **.xcodeproj** extension.
4. XCode will launch and you can then run the sample code by running the iPhone or iPad simulator


## Recap 

The basic workflow that you may find your self following is this.

1. Create a project using the PhoneGap CLI
2. Inside the project, make the changes to files inside the **WWW** folder
3. Do a build either in Android, iOS or any platform you like
4. If you are using Android, you can test and deploy using the PhoneGap CLI &mdash; `phonegap run android`
5. If you are on iOS, just build the project using `phonegap build ios`, then do the testing, simulation and deployment using XCode

Regardless of the platform you are targetting, you will make the code changes in the **WWW** folder of PhoneGap, and the *www* of either Android, iOS or WP7/8

## VOCABULARY

1. PhoneGap CLI
2. XCode
3. Android Emulator
4. iOS Simulator
5. cmd - short for command, so if you see something like *cmd line*, that means command line, which means do it from a terminal window.
