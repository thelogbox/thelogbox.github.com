My name is Ted Hagos. I work for RenditionDigital Inc. It is an outsourcing company that is involved heavily in software development. I hold a technical management position. I also teach. I taught at Asia Pacific College, IBM Advance Career Education and Ateneo ITI. That's probably what you need to know about the author of this work.

There is side navigation bar on this mini site. Use them as you would a **table of contents** in a book. I tried to organize them as such. The side bar is organized sequentially. You can get the most information by following this sequence.
