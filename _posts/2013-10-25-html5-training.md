The training covers the new structural elements of HTML5, WebWorkers, WebSockets, GEOLocation etc, but the main thrust of this training will be on Canvas and SVG Programming. This is the part of HTML5 that a lot of people are referring to as the *flash killer*. When you see a job advertisement looking for HTML5 developers, most likely they are referring the HTML5 Canvas programmers. 

Knowledge of the structural elements and other goodies of HTML5, important as they are, are eclipsed by knowledge of Canvas programmingâ€”simply because this is the skill that is rising in demand.
