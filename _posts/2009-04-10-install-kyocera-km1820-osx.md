## To connect OSX to a Kyocera KM-1820, you will need the following.

1. The KPDL driver of Kyocera, you can download it at [kyocera](http://www.kyoceramita.co.uk/index/products/download_centre.false.driver.FS1118MFP._.EN.html#)
2. StuffIt expander, you can download it at [stuffit](http://www.StuffIt.com)


## If the Kyocera printer is a networked printer


1. Download the StuffIt expander, double-click the DMG installer and follow the prompts -- you can copy the StuffIt application file into your usual "Applications" folder for easy access in the future.
2. Download the Kyocera KM-1820 driver, the file could be an HTX file, OSX would know what to do with it, it will simply expand the HTX file. As as result of the expansion, it may produce the "Archive.sitx" file--this is where you will use the StuffIt expander. Double Archive.sitx, it will produce a PKG file (Kyocera OS X v1.1), just double click the PKG file.
3. Open the System Preferences dialog (from the Apple logo on the upper-left hand side of your desktop. Choose "Print & Fax"
4. Click the plus (+) sign at the lower left hand side of the "Print and Fax" dialog. Find the printer location (if it's a shared printer on the network).
5. On the "Print using" drop-down option, choose "Select printer software", you should be able to find the KM-1820 option by now.
