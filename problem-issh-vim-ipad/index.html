      <h2 id="motivations">Motivations</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>To login remotely to a Linux machine via SSH using the iPad</li>
<li>To use tmux (screen multiplexer) and vim to edit source files</li>
</ol><h2 id="problems-encountered-when-using-issh">Problems encountered when using iSSH</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Couldn not get 256 colors to work. Elsewhere on the Internet (forums etc), the instruction were to set the 256 color on the Advanced settings and/or to set the <em>TERM</em> variable equal to <em>term-256color</em>, which I did, but still could not get it to work. The <strong>Prompt</strong> app though worked out of the box, I did not have to fiddle with anything</p></li>
<li><p>The Vim screen was wobbling when editing. The wobbling I think is being caused by Vim doing a little bit if intellisense on matching braces, quotes and parentheses. I think it was also being caused by the status line jittering.</p></li>

<p>Later, after inspecting my .vimrc on the target machine, I found out that I had a :set columns=100. This was causing the wobbling and the display of weird characters in iSSH. My iSSH screen settings was not wide enough to accomodate 100 columns as set in my .vimrc. I did not want to change my .vimrc hence, I just enlarged my screen size in iSSH (how to do to this)</p>

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The CTRL key doesn't work, I actually still don't know how to make it work. Yes, I have enabled Options Mapping.</li>
</ol><p>This is a deal killer, Vim uses this alot when switching between split windows (C-w w). Tmux uses this a lot more. This is enough reason why I chose Prompt, the CTRL key works out-of-the-box</p>
<h2 id="why-i-chose-prompt-over-issh-despite-issh-being-cheaper.">Why I chose Prompt over iSSH, despite iSSH being cheaper.</h2>
<p>Prompt is another SSH client on the iPad. It is less capable in terms of bells and whistles, but it does have everything I need and none of the problems I have with iSSH. I don't use the iPad to VNC or to connect via Remote Desktop Connection anyway, just SSH</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>the CTRL keys work out of the box, using a bluetooth keyboard. I could not get it to work on iSSH. Despite trying a lot of acrobatics on the settings -- Yes. I did try enable Options Mapping. No joy!</p></li>
<li><p>Prompt appeared a bit faster too</p></li>
</ol><p>If not for my frustration on the CTRL keys not working out of the box on iSSH, it would have been a better fit for my use, because;</p>
<ul>
<li>The size of the screen can configured via a slider control. This was not available on Prompt. You could choose the size of the font (but not the screen font itself)</li>
<li>It was more intuitive if you need another SSH session, just press the plus sign (+) on the top portion of the screen</li>
<li>It had lot more controls than Prompt.</li>
</ul><p>I bought the two apps anyway. It seems though, I find my self using the Prompt more than I use iSSH</p>
