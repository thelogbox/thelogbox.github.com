I wrote this for Steph. Hopefully, she will have a genuine interest in programming and that she may find this note as a useful learning resource as she goes through her college programming subjects, I know that this term, it is C#, hence, these notes. If you happen to find this note on the world wild web, you are probably one of my daughterâ€™s classmate, groupmate or one of my former students, whoever you maybe, I hope you find this note useful. I wrote it to guide beginning programmers on their first few steps towards a very long journey in software development.
